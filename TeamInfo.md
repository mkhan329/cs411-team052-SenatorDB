## Project Summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project, the data for member votes of the 117th congress (2021-2023) will be used to display the data of roll call votes that happened. Users can see which party favors a particular bill or nomination, or what a particular senator voted for or against. Users can also perform Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Search operations on the data.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The (planned) creative component of this project is to visualize the data into a graphic form, presumably with javascript and existing libraries.Data from [voteview.com](https://voteview.com/data) will be used. SQL and Python will be used for database management and data analysis. While HTML, CSS, and Javascript will be used for the front-end.
