# Project Proposal

## 1. Project Title
US Congressional Voting Record Analysis
## 2. Project Summary
In this project, the voting records of Senators from the 117th Congress (2021-2023) will be analyzed. This analysis will display the results of roll call votes over the duration of the 117th Congress. Users will be able to query this data in different ways, such as making categories based on Senator political parties and State origin, or looking at which roll call votes were favoured by certain parties. Users can also perform Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Search operations on the data.

The data set for this project consists of tables showing all Senators in the 117th Congress, roll call votes that have been voted on, the results of such votes, and the individual votes of Senators for each bill. Senators in the dataset can be identified by their distinct ICSPSR numbers, and roll call votes can be identified by their distinct roll call number. The votes of senators can be shown for each bill, with the following table explaining votes:

| Cast Codes |       Description    |
| -----------|----------------------|
| 0  |       Not a member of the chamber when this vote was taken     |
| 1  |      Yea    |
| 2  |      Paired Yea     |
| 3  |      Announced Yea     |
| 4  |      Announced Nay     |
| 5  |      Paired Nay     |
| 6  |      Nay     |
| 7  |      Present (some Congresses)     |
| 8  |      Present (some Congresses)     |
| 9  |      Not Voting (Abstention)     |
